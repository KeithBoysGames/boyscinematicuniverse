                    <p class="info-text">Jerome Lopez was created by Roman in 2021. He is best known for his giant nose and strength based weaponry. Jerome was originally created in <i>Dark Souls Remastered</i> and had a very skinny face and a giant great club as his weapon. In later iterations of Jerome, his face evened out more and he used other giant weapons such as the great sword from <i>Monster Hunter: World</i> and <i>Prelate's Inferno Crozier</i> from <i>Elden Ring</i>. Jerome has killed the hardest boss in his specified game but is not max level.</p>
                    <p class="info-text">Jerome appears in multiple titles such as <i>Monster Hunter: World</i>, <i>Elden Ring</i>, <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i>, and <i>The Sims 4</i>. Jeromes appearance in Elden ring is similar to his Dark Souls Remastered appearance, but his face is slightly more fleshed out. In Grand Theft Auto V, we see a younger version of Jerome in his early 20's roaming the streets of Los Santos. In <i>Monster Hunter: World</i>, Jerome sports a long sword or a great sword and wears heavy armor. Jerome's appearance in The Sims 4 is different then all the rest. He has a wife and kids and is a fitness teacher. His wifes name is Stephanie Lopez.</p>
